## Not covered
Reading from JSON data -- NO IDEA if this is the correct way to read JSON data OR display them...

## Learnings
I added a third ViewController as the edit view and doing so complicated things. The same data from the first view is pushed to the detail view, then to the edit view. Not sure how to update both sources of data... so chained them. Q. How to properly do this??
